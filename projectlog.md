Ultimately scrapped in favor of React Native framework for better functionality                                                                                                                                                                 |

"React Native Web" plugin was required to make it function as a web app as well.                                                                                                                                                                             |

WebRTC protocol needs a TURN server which is relatively expensive compared to a STUN server because of firewall. Wrote a simple User control page with video streaming and text sending features                 |

I changed to using WebSocket which establishes a TCP connection |
