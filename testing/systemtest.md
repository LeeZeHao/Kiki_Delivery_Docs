# System Testing
  
System testing was done to ensure our system functions correctly as a whole. In particular, we focused on the user flow, making sure that the user doesn’t encounter errors during use of our project.  
  
As of Milestone 3, interactions / Features tested with success are as follows:  
1. User can register  
2. User can receive verification email (and must verify email before being allowed to log in)  
3. User can log in and log out  
4. User can reset password  
5. User can view information on the Home screen  
6. User can view information and change username in Profile screen  
7. User can “buy” drone usage time (no payment system implemented yet, but data is saved to cloud properly)  
8. User can use button on Home screen to rent a drone (bring them to the control page)  
9. User can see their own webcam view on control page  
10. User can connect to drone on control page  
11. User can see drone’s webcam view and hear audio from drone on control page  
12. Audio from user is played by drone  
13. User can control the drone movement reliably (without significant lag, input delay etc)   
14. User can control the drone camera rotation reliably (without significant lag, input delay etc)  
15. User can control the drone scissor lift reliably (without significant lag, input delay etc)  
16. In case of bad internet connection or sudden disconnection learning to interruption of control signals, drone stops safely
