# Testing

Due to the large number of different technologies used, and the complexity of getting multiple pieces of software to interact properly, testing is essential in ensuring this project performs as expected.  
  
Various types of testing which were performed are listed in the following sections.

NOTE: As we seek to support both platforms, all testing which involves the client app has been performed using both Web and Android devices.
