# User Data and Profile

User data, including email, username, and drone usage time (discussed below), is stored via Firebase Firestore database. On first login, users are prompted to choose a username. This data is stored in this system. Any purchase or decrease in drone usage time is also saved in this way.  
  
Users can view their current account information, and change their username in the profile page.
