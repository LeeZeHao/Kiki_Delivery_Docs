# Scissor Lift

A scissor lift feature was added as an extension to the robot. This allows for the robot's top half frame to be lifted up, increasing the height by approximately 70cm.

This allows for the camera to have a better view. As the height of the speaker, webcam and microphone are now closer to human height, it also provides better communication with others.  
  
The user is able to control the extension of the lift via action buttons on the right side of the client drone control interface.
