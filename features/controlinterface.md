The control page is the user interface for connecting to the robot and controlling it.  
  
Users in the control page can  
- Establish connection to the drone (access code system below not implemented yet)  
- Observe their own camera view on top right corner  
- Observe the drone’s camera view in middle of screen  
- Input text to be sent and displayed on the drone  
- Control the movement of drone using a virtual joystick on the bottom left side of the screen  
- Disable their own microphone or camera  
- View drone usage time left  
- Control extra functions such as camera rotation and other actuators using action buttons on the bottom right side of the screen  
- Disconnect the drone (This will also stop the consumption of drone usage time (detailed under “Drone usage timer system” section))
