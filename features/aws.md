# AWS Deployment

AWS (Amazon Web Services) Amplify was used to host both the Client App and User Drone Control Interface for this project.  

AWS pulls source code from the GitHub repository. A BASh script is written in the amplify.yml file for AWS Amplify to execute after pulling the source code.  

Links to the hosted sites are as below:  
[Client App](https://zehao-deploy-rn-web-app.dfdd2g2tqknko.amplifyapp.com/)  
[User Drone Control Interface](https://main.d22eytntr7s98d.amplifyapp.com/control/)  
(NOTE: User Drone Control Interface Cannot be directly accessed by this link as authentication will fail. The URL is mainly for the client app to open the webpage with correct access key arguments.)
