# Rotating Camera Mount

The rotating camera mount allows the user to rotate the camera across an arc. This allows the user to rotate the camera view, allowing for better situational awareness and visual capabilities than a fixed camera.  

This is achieved via two servo motors, which rotate different parts of the camera housing.

The Yaw Motor rotates the top part of the mount (along with the Pitch motor) side-to-side, providing yaw rotation for the camera view.  
The Pitch motor rotates the camera up and down, providing pitch rotation for the camera view.
In total, this provides two degrees of freedom for the camera rotation system.
  
The user can control the camera via the right joystick (lower right corner of screen) in the client side control interface.
