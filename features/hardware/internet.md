# Internet Connectivity

### Proposed

A wireless method for the drone to connect to the internet. Must be supported by Raspberry Pi 5 and able to provide suitable internet specs to support WebRTC video calls.  

### Current Progress

A SIM7600 Raspberry Pi HAT module is used to provide 4G internet connectivity. During testing, it has proven sufficient for smooth operation and video / audio feed.
