# 3D Printed Components

Large parts of the frame, scissor lift, camera mount were designed as digital 3D models and produced using 3D printers.

### 3D Modelling

Autodesk Fusion 360 was used as the main CAD tool in designing these parts. 

Care was taken while designing the parts so that they could fit into the 3D printers' build volume. Fusion 360's cloud sync function was used for easy collaboration between team members.  

The drone's 3D model can be viewed [HERE](https://a360.co/3WbbWRR)

### Slicing

The 3D models were then exported as .stl files, and passed into CURA 3D printing slicer software. They are then turned into .gcode files, which can be accepted by 3D printers as instruction files.

### Printing

Printing was done on a Creality Ender 3 Neo and a Creality Ender 3 V2. The material used was 1.75mm PLA filament.
