# Power System

A battery that can support all systems on the robot.   
  
The battery is rechargeable, and able to handle the large power draw of the motors while still maintaining stable power to the Raspberry Pi controller. 
  
A purchased rechargeable lithium ion battery is being used. It is able to reliably fulfill the requirements stated above, while still maintaining a reasonable battery life and charging time.
  
The specifications of the current battery are as follows:  
Voltage: 12V   
Max current: 3A  
Capacity: 9800mAh  

During testing with the current setup, we have found that the expected operational time per charge is  2.5 hours.
The time required to charge the battery from empty is approximately 8 hours.

While we recognize that better battery technology options exist, these specifications are sufficient for this stage of development and testing.
