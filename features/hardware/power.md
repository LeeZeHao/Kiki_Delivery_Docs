# Power System

### Proposed

A battery that can support all systems on the robot.   
  
The battery should be rechargeable, and able to handle the large power draw of the motors while still maintaining stable power to the Raspberry Pi controller. 


### Current Progress

A purchased rechargeable lithium ion battery is being used. It is able to reliably fulfill the requirements stated above.  
  
The specifications of the current battery are as follows:  
Voltage: 12V   
Max current: 3A  
Capacity: 9800mAh

Current build of the drone. The battery (blue block) is visible. We have not yet designed a proper mount for the battery, but it is working in this state.

Future planned arrangement of drone internals. Battery is fit in the middle, while Raspberry Pi 5 is fit at the front for optimal cooling.
