# Scissor Lift

A scissor lift feature was added as an extension to the robot. This allows for the robot's top half frame to be lifted up, increasing the height by approximately 70cm.

This allows for the camera to have a better view. As the height of the speaker, webcam and microphone are now closer to human height, it also provides better communication with others.  

The lift is a simple scissor lift system. It is powered by a screw thread driven by a 12V DC motor, which pulls / pushes on one of the bottom arms of the lift. This system is simple and does not require an additional braking system to stop the lift from falling.  
  
The user is able to control the extension of the lift via action buttons on the right side of the client drone control interface.
