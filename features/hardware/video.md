# Video and Audio

Microphone and camera hardware is installed so that the drone can record video and audio to send to the user. Speaker is installed so that audio from the user end can be played.  
  
A USB webcam (with integrated mic) provide video and audio recording capability. Both of these functions work as expected. The field of view is greatly increased from the last version, significantly improving the experience of the user controlling the drone.  
  
A USB speaker is also available for playing audio from the user. Along with the microphone, the system in its current state can thus provide two-way audio communication.
