# Drone Frame

The frame of the drone holds all other electrical and electronic components in place.  

It is made of custom 3D printed parts and an acrylic plate bottom chassis. The 3D printed parts were modelled in Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed using Creality Ender 3 printers, while the acrylic plate chassis was purchased along with the motors.  
  
The frame can be divided roughly into two sections: the top frame and the bottom frame. There is a scissor lift between the top and bottom part, allowing for the top half to be lifted. (see: Features -> Scissor Lift section)  

### Bottom Part

The bottom part consists of a 3D printed frame on top of an acrylic chassis.

The chassis is made of two acryllic plates, and provides mounting points for the 4 DC motors that provide locomotion. Motor drivers used for the locomotion motors also fit in this space.
  
The 3D printed frame is fixed to the top plate of the chassis. It provides mounting points for the Raspberry Pi 5 microcomputer, the battery, and the 4G SIM7600 Raspberry Pi HAT module. There is an opening on the front and rear of the frame to allow air cooling for the battery and Raspberry Pi.

The motor and bottom struts for the scissor lift are also mounted here.

### Top Part

The top half of the frame is attached to the top of the scissor lift. This allows anything mounted or carried on it to be affected by the lift as well.  
  
The webcam (with integrated microphone) and the speaker are both mounted to the top part.  
  
There is also a box compartment in the middle, which provides some carrying capacity for the drone.
