# Drone Frame

The frame of the drone holds all other electrical and electronic components in place. It is made of custom 3D printed parts and an acrylic plate bottom chassis.  
  
The frame can be divided roughly into two sections: the top frame and the bottom frame. There is a scissor lift between the top and bottom part, allowing for the top half to be lifted. (see: Features -> Scissor Lift section)

The bottom part consists of a 3D printed frame on top of an acryllic chassis.
