# Unit, Integration and System Testing

Testing was done during development in order to verify the functionality of individual pieces of code, and to ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected.  
  
As mentioned above, our project is split into several mostly independent pieces of software, which communicate with each other. Any interactions between them (Redirecting user from client app to control interface, WebRTC communication between control interface and drone, etc) have to remain reliable throughout development. Therefore, testing must remain a constant of our software engineering process.
