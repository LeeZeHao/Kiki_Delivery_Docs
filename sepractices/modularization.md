# Modularization

This is a hybrid hardware/software project with significant complexity. Due to both necessity of the technologies being used (for instance, it is easiest to drive hardware with Raspberry Pi using Python scripts), and In order to ensure easy collaboration, the software section of the project consists of multiple sections, including:  
- Client app (Written using React Native + Expo framework)  
- Client drone control interface (Written using basic HTML + JS)  
- Drone end web app (Written using basic HTML + JS)  
- Drone hardware Python control script (Written using Python)
