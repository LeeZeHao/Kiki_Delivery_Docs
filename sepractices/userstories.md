# User Stories

User stories are created to understand the needs and expectations of the users. In such a project, the user stories are important for learning which features to focus on.  
  
Using our Milestone One feedback, we have decided to focus our project on the needs of small businesses and individuals who need a cheap and quick drone solution for short to medium term projects. We also recognized that this type of system is likely most useful for surveying or monitoring.   
  
Therefore, we have decided to focus on camera quality, mobility and ease of use. The user stories are detailed above in the “User Stories” section of this README.
