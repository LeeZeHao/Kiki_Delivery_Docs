# UI/UX Design

UI/UX design ensures an interface that users can interact with easily and without confusion.  
  
In our project, UI/UX design mainly comes into play for the client app and client drone control interface, as these are the user facing components of the system.  
  
In the client app, the interfaces are designed to be simple with large UI elements. This ensures users are not confused, and do not have to strain to read info. The home page also contains all the important information for users so that it can be checked at a glance.  
  
In the drone control interface, there is a large screen displaying the droneâ€™s viewpoint in the middle. There are large joysticks at the side. This interface is similar to the layout of certain handheld game UIs, and is designed for ease of use on touchscreen devices.  
  
As a side note, input lag and responsive controls can be considered part of UX as well. Therefore, we have worked to reduce the lag time between input, drone movement, and visual feedback via the camera. We are pleased to say that during testing (using separate networks, from each of our own homes) the lag does not impede control much at all.
