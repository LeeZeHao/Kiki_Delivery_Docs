# Documentation

Documentation is important for maintaining a knowledge base of a project, which can be quickly updated, shared and understood.  

Our project is documented in multiple ways for different use cases.

### README / Main Documentation Site

This is the most detailed and in depth documentation of the project, and also the documentation you are currently reading. It provides detailed information on project scope and goals, and explains various features and aspects of the project in detail.  

This documentation site was created using a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) Theme (template) known as [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). The site is hosted for free using GitHub Pages.  

The Jekyll theme supports using files in .md Markdown format to create pages. This allows documentation to be written and edited easily even without specialized web dev knowledge. A CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment) GitHub Actions pipeline was included with the template, enabling updates to be deployed to the site quickly.  

Users can navigate the site easily using the sidebar, or search for specific words using the search bar.  

The GitHub repository for the documentation can be found [HERE](https://github.com/LeeZeHao/Kiki_Delivery_Docs).  

### Project Log

This is a log of time spent on various tasks throughout the project. This helps to monitor project progress such that goals and milestones are met on time.  

It records every major task, date performed, time spent by each team member, and details about the task.  

The project log is part of the README / Main documentation site. It is available under "Project Log" in the sidebar.  


### Project Demonstration Video

A short video demonstrating the project's capabilities, and briefly explaining certain aspects.  

The video is edited using DaVinci Resolve.
