# Version Control

Version control is useful in creating a structure for backups, logging changes and collaboration.  
  
Our team uses Git (with GitHub) for version control. Each time a team member starts work on a task, a new branch is created with the name format [team member name]-[task]. We are also able to rollback to previous versions if we need to.  
  
Issues are also tracked via GitHub. They are linked to Milestones (coinciding with Orbital's own milestones). They include improvements, bug fixes and documentation tasks, and are created, delegated and updated continuously throughout the project.
