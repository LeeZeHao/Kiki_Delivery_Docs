# User Stories
As any user who wants to use an FPV ground drone to achieve remote tasks, I want to be able to have responsive control of the robot.  
  
As a commercial user who wants to easily keep watch over my area of business, I want to be able to use the drone to perform supervision / patrols with a clear video feed.  
  
As someone who wants to use the drone to interact with other organization or project members, I want to be able to communicate through the drone (via video / audio).  
  
As a owner of a small business, I want to use the remote drone with real-time video feed at any time, so that I can survey or supervise my work area remotely without the need for an expensive drone setup.  
  
As the manager of a small to medium-scale project, I want to rent the remote drone for short periods of time, so that I can monitor the situation and progress without spending project time and resources to set up a new drone system.  
  
As someone who is bedridden due to disability or illness, I want to rent the remote drone temporarily, so that I can perform actions like buying essentials without having to leave the house.  
  
As someone who thinks the Singaporean weather is too hot to go outside ourselves, I want to rent a remote drone at a low cost, so that I can buy food without leaving the comfort of my home.
